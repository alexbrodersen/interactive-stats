This is a bookdown document that is intended to be living documentation for all activities that need to be accomplished in our lab. By carefully reading all of this documentation, you will develop a set of valuable skills. Specifically, we hope that you will learn Data Visualization Programming (R, Python, Javascript, SQL) Statistics Psychometrics Data Science Research Design in Psychology Educational Research Methodology Online Data Collection Version Control Intermixed in the documentation and learning materials, you may find quizzes to evaluate your learning. These quizzes are linked to your personal login account and help us know that you have successfully completed a module that is relevent. The more modules you complete, the better you will be able to help out the lab. "],
["programming.html", "2 Programming 2.1 Install R 2.2 Install RStudio 2.3 Quiz", " 2 Programming Much of what you do in this lab will require you to be able to program. It is okay if you don’t have any experience with this - most psychologists get their first experiences programming in graduate school. In our lab we primarily use four programming languages. Python - General Purpose Scripting Language R - Statistical Programming Language c++ - fast scientific computing SQL - Database programming language. Javascript - Used for Building Websites The majority of this tutorial will be written in R. That is because R is a pretty user friendly programming language. That means: - It’s difficult to break your whole computer because you messed something up while using R. - The syntax is mostly intuitive and easy to understand. - It’s pretty easy to learn another programming language once you have learned R. Additionally, and we use it extensively for our data analysis in the lab (with very few exceptions). Before you learn R, you must install it on your computer. For most people, this also means installing an integrated development environment called RStudio. RStudio is an excellent choice for a text editor when learning R. It has many tools that make usering R easier. 2.1 Install R 2.1.1 Mac Users Open an internet browser and go to www.r-project.org. Click the “download R” link in the middle of the page under “Getting Started.” Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link. Click on the “Download R for (Mac) OS X” link at the top of the page. Click on the file containing the latest version of R under “Files.” Save the .pkg file, double-click it to open, and follow the installation instructions. Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio. 2.1.2 Windows Users Open an internet browser and go to www.r-project.org. Click the “download R” link in the middle of the page under “Getting Started.” Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link. Click on the “Download R for Windows” link at the top of the page. Click on the “install R for the first time” link at the top of the page. Click “Download R for Windows” and save the executable file somewhere on your computer. Run the .exe file and follow the installation instructions. Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio. 2.2 Install RStudio 2.2.1 Mac Users Go to www.rstudio.com and click on the “DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP” button towards the bottom of the page. Click on the version recommended for your system, or the latest Mac version, save the .dmg file on your computer, double-click it to open, and then drag and drop it to your applications folder. 2.2.2 Windows Users Go to www.rstudio.com and click on the “DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP” button towards the bottom of the page. Click on the version recommended for your system, or the latest Windows version, and save the executable file. Run the .exe file and follow the installation instructions. 2.3 Quiz "],
["projects.html", "3 Projects 3.1 AP-CAT 3.2 i-DAP", " 3 Projects The Psychological and Educational measurement lab has two majors projects with related but distinct goals. The first project was an National Science Foundation funded project, titled Advanced Placement - Computerized Adaptive Test (AP-CAT), which had the goal of developing a system to provide adaptive, highly granular feedback to high school students in Advanced Placement statistics courses. The second project, the intelligent Diagnostic Assessment Program, (i-DAP) is funded by the Institute for Educational Initiatives, with the intention of developing an automated tutoring system for general high school statistics courses. Below is some information on both projects, and some common requirements for those projects. 3.1 AP-CAT 3.2 i-DAP "],
["data-cleaning.html", "4 Data Cleaning 4.1 Tidyverse", " 4 Data Cleaning Cleaning data refers to the process of taking data and transforming it into a format that is useful for future analysis. Some common data cleaning tasks include: Converting data such that a single row represents a single study participant and a single column represents a single variable. Transforming variables, such as reverse coding a variable. Creating summary variables. An example of this might be createing a new variable that is the avgerage of a set of other variable - like you might do to calculate a grade on a test. Merge data from multiple sources Rename variables so that it is clear exactly what that variable represents. 4.1 Tidyverse The tidyverse is a set of R packages that are used for cleaning, visualizing, and modeling data. The tidyverse adds a common framework with a strict vocabulary that enables a user to write code that is very clean and human readable. In our lab, we have been in process of converting over to the tidyverse for data cleaning. Usually, you may only use a couple of the packages from the tidyverse. However, it is best to install the whole tidyverse so that you don’t have to wait in the future if there is another package you need. NOTE: This can take a long time to install, depending on your operating system. # Install the whole tidyverse: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) # Or the development version from GitHub: # install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;tidyverse/tidyr&quot;) "],

["ethics.html", "6 Ethics 6.1 CITI Training", " 6 Ethics Given that we are collecting data from humans, there are additional ethical concerns with how data are collected, transmitted, and stored. Severe penalties can be imposed for failure to abide by these guidlines, and as such it is important to be well versed in them if you will be handling data collected in our lab. 6.1 CITI Training The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) is an organization that provides learning materials and educational courses that focus on “research, ethics, regulatory oversight, responsible conduct of research, research administration, and other topics pertinent to the interests of member organizations and individual learners”. From the CITI website: These materials are designed and regularly updated to: Enhance the knowledge and professionalism of investigators, staff, and students conducting research in the United States and internationally Educate members, administrators, and leadership of ethics committees that review and oversee research Promote ethical research at organizations through the education of research administrators and organizational leadership Notre Dame has an institutional license its members to obtain training provided by CITI. To access it, do the following: Click this link: CITI Training Click “Log In” on the top right. Click “LOG IN THROUGH MY INSTITUTION” at the top. Scroll down to select “University of Notre Dame” Follow the required steps (If applicable). You will only be required to compete the Social &amp; Behavioral Research under the Human Subjects Research section. This can be found by clicking “View Courses” and then “Add a Course”. "]
